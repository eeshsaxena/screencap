# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ScreenCap is a macOS CLI for screen recording. The recording engine lives at `src/screencap/engine/` as an internal sub-package. Python >= 3.10, macOS only.

A native SwiftUI app shell lives at `macos/` and wraps the bundled CLI; see "macOS SwiftUI app shell" below for details.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install (editable dev mode)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run a single test file or test
pytest tests/test_cli.py
pytest tests/test_catalog.py::test_list_recordings_empty

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov
```

Linting uses `ruff` for the engine sub-package: `ruff check src/screencap/engine/`.

## Key Patterns

- All user-facing output uses `rich.console.Console` (no bare `print()`).
- Heavy imports are deferred inside CLI command bodies to keep `screencap --help` fast.
- SQLite access in the `screencap` layer uses raw `sqlite3`, not SQLAlchemy.
- Recording dirs live at `~/.screencap/recordings/<name>/`.



## Documented Solutions

`docs/solutions/` — documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (`module`, `tags`, `problem_type`). Relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas.
